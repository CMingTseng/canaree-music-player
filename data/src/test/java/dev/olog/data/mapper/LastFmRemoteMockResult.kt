It is noted for its use of a peculiar sound effect on the singer's vocals, which is referred to as the Cher effect today.\n\n\"Believe\" was written by a number of writers including Paul Barry, Matt Gray, Brian Higgins, Stuart McLellan, Timothy Powell, and Steven Torch. The song, released and recorded in 1998, peaked at number one in 23 countries worldwide .In the second week of March, 1999, it reached number one in the Billboard Hot 100, making Cher the oldest female artist (at the age of 52) to perform this feat. It also was ranked as the number-one song of 1999 by Billboard, and became the biggest single in her entire career. \"Believe\" also spent seven weeks at number one] in the UK singles chart and is still the best selling single by a female artist in the UK. \n\n\nIn March 2007, the United World Chart ranked \"Believe\" as the sixteenth most successful song in music history. The same chart lists \"Believe\" as third most successful song released by a solo female musician behind Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" and Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On; [5], the biggest selling single ever for Warner Bros. Records and the biggest selling dance song ever having sold over 10 million copies worldwide. It was also the song with most weeks in the top ten, it stayed in the top ten for 28 weeks.\n\nThe success of the song not only expanded through each country's singles chart, but also most country's dance charts. In the United States \"Believe\" spent 23 weeks on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart and 22 weeks on the European Hot Dance Charts. \"Believe\" also set a record in 1999 after spending 21 weeks in the top spot of the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales chart, it was still in the top ten even one year after its entry on the chart. \n\n\"Believe\" was given the featured closing number spot for over 100 performances on Cher's 1999-2000 Do You Believe? Tour and then again the closing spot for over 300 performances on Cher's epic 2002-2005 Living Proof: The Farewell Tour. The song ranked #74 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s.\n\nAn interesting note about the recording of the song revolved around the highly-recognizable Auto-tune effect (\"Cher effect\") utilized in the verses and chorus. Producer Mark Taylor added the effect to Cher's vocal simply as a lark, and in interviews at the time, he claimed to be testing out his recently purchased the 'DigiTech Talker'. However, it later emerged that the effect was not created by a vocoder, but by utilizing extreme (and then unheard) settings on auto-tune.When Cher heard the results, she demanded that the effect remain in the song, and her original vocal be erased, much to the chagrin of her record company, who wanted it removed; upon their suggestion, Cher's response to the record label was \"over my dead body!\"[citation needed] The vocal effect is caused by a pitch correction speed that is \"set too fast for the audio that it is processing.\" \n\n\nU.S. Billboard Hot 100 Airplay\t1\nU.S. Billboard Hot 100\t1\nU.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play\t1\nU.S. Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales\t1\nU.S. Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks\t2\nU.S. Billboard Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks\t2\nU.S. Billboard Top 40 Mainstream\t2\nArgentinian Singles Chart\t2\nAustralian ARIA Singles Chart\t1\nAustrian Singles Chart\t2\nBelgian Singles Chart\t1\nBrazilian Airplay Chart\t1\nCroatian Singles Chart\t1\nCanadian Singles Chart\t1\nDanish Singles Chart\t1\nDutch Mega Top 50 Singles Chart\t1\nDutch Top 40\t1\nEuropean Singles Chart\t1\nFinnish Singles Chart\t6\nFrench Singles Chart\t1\nGerman Singles Chart\t1\nIrish Singles Chart\t1\nIsraeli Singles Chart\t1\nItalian Singles Chart\t1\nLatvian Singles Chart\t1\nMexican Singles Chart\t1\nNew Zealand's Singles Chart\t1\nNorwegian Singles Chart\t1\nPolish Singles Chart\t1\nSpanish Singles Chart\t1\nSwedish Singles Chart\t1\nSwedish Airplay Chart\t1\nSwiss Singles Chart\t1\nUK Singles Chart\t1\nUnited World Chart\t1\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cher/_/Believe\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

"content": "Cher (born Cherilyn Sarkisian; May 20, 1946) is an Oscar- and Grammy-winning American singer and actress. A major figure for over five decades in the world of popular culture, she is often referred to as the Goddess of Pop for having first brought the sense of female autonomy and self-actualization into the entertainment industry. \n\nShe is known for her distinctive contralto and for having worked extensively across media, as well as for continuously reinventing both her music and image, the latter of which has been known to induce controversy.\n\nCher was born Cherilyn Sarkisian in El Centro, California, on May 20, 1946. She is of Armenian-American, Irish, English, German, and Cherokee ancestry. Cher first caught the eye and ear of the public in 1965 as one-half of the pop rock duo Sonny & Cher, which popularized a peculiar smooth sound that competed successfully with the predominant British Invasion and Motown Sound of the era. After a period in which the duo became obsolete, she re-emerged in the 1970's as a television personality with her shows The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour and Cher, which attained great popularity.\n\nAt the same time, she established herself as a solo artist with hits such as \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\", \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\", \"Half-Breed\", and \"Dark Lady\", which dealt with taboo subjects in mainstream popular music. Throughout, she cemented her status as a fashion trendsetter with her daring outfits, and was noted as being the first woman to expose her navel on television. Cher's impact at that time, as described by Phill Marder from Goldmine magazine, \"led the way to advance feminine rebellion in the rock world,\" as she was \"the prototype of the female rock star, setting the standard for appearance and [...] attitude[.]\"\n\nIn 1983 Cher made a critically acclaimed appearance on Broadway and starred in the film Silkwood, which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In the following years, she became an acclaimed film actress by starring in a string of hit films, including Mask, The Witches of Eastwick, and Moonstruck, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1988. At the same time, she established herself as a \"serious rock and roller\" by releasing a series of rock albums and hit singles such as \"I Found Someone\", \"If I Could Turn Back Time\", and \"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\".\n\nShe made her directing debut with the film If These Walls Could Talk in 1996 and released the biggest-selling single of her career thus far, \"Believe\", which revolutionized the recording industry because of its pioneer use of Auto-Tune (also known as the \"Cher effect\"). Throughout the 2000's she embarked on a series of concert tours that were among the highest-grossing of all-time.\n\nCher has won an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival for her work in film, music and television. She is the only person  to receive all of these awards. She is also the only artist to have notched a number-one single on a Billboard chart in each of the past six decades. Recognized as one of the best-selling music artists of all time, she has sold more than 100 million solo albums worldwide and 40 million records as part of Sonny & Cher.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.cher.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cher\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
